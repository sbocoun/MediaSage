## Project Details
This project allows user to add, rate and get recommendation for contents they enjoy, such as movies, televisions, 
and eventually more types of other media.

This project aims to be a useful tool to help users keep track of all the different media 
they've enjoyed across different medium in one single place, and ways for them to discover more content
they might also like based on their interests.

It was made as part of a course project for us, but we hope it can develop into something more helpful for 
the average user as well.
