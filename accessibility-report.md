## Principles of Universal Design Checklist
1. **Equitable Use.** Our program is not yet equitable in use by all users. To remedy it, we could use libraries that
can make the program more screen-reader friendly for visually impaired users, or create a translation layer for all
strings used in the program to make localizing the program easier for users whose primary language is not English.
2. **Flexibility in use.** Our program is flexible to be used by a user to keep track of multiple media formats. 
Right now movies and television shows are supported, and more media types can be added in the future to help make it 
more flexible.
3. **Simple and Intuitive Use.** Our program is primarily text based and not very intuitive to use it. To help remedy the issue, we should include
more graphical components in the UI, such as using an icon alongside text in each of the buttons, or change the primary
media collection list table to incorporate movie/tv posters in the main interface.
4. **Perceptible Information.** The information displayed in teh program is not very legible for the users right now,
as multiple categories of each of the movie/tv media contains information that cannot be displayed without resizing
the program. To remedy this, in the future, we could make the information in each entry display in multi-line format,
as well as use an infobox or a pop-out menu that contains a more well-formatted details screen for each media.
5. **Tolerance for Error.** Our program is tolerable for error, since we have confirmations for unrecoverable actions such as 
moving and deleting media. But they would be unable to restore media once deleted/moved. To remedy this, we could implement an 
undo feature for delete/move/rating change use cases that allows the user to revert their changes.
7. **Low Physical Effort.** This principle does not quite apply to our program or most software in general, since 
little physical effort aside from reading and operating input/output devices are required to use our program.
8. **Size and Space for Approach and Use.** This does not quite apply to our program, since it's mostly a software 
interface. We did use default window sizes for our application to make sure all views are visible without having to 
resize the window, which should accommodate the display of most monitors.

## Primary Market
This software is primarily designed for people who like to consume audiovisual media, such as movies, television shows 
and other visual media, and eventually could include audio media such as music and audio drama. 
The program would allow these users to keep track of their favorite media properties, look up more entries in their
preferred medium, and get recommendations for more media they might enjoy based on their preferred titles.
Users who enjoy multimedia properties would also benefit from our program, as it offers a single place to store their
watch list across different media types, and could offer recommendation based on those different media types.

## Demographics
By the design goal of our software, people who have challenges consuming audio or visual media would be less likely to use our
software, as they would not need the features offered by our software. Due to this, the lack of accommodations for these
users would not cause relational harm to them.
Since our program's interface is English and does not currently offer localizations in different languages, users whose
primary language is not English would also be less likely to ues it. These users would experience relational harm due to
a lack of accommodations, so to remedy that, we need to eventually implement a way to offer a localization change 
feature for our program to change the language of the text labels.
